## nosql vs sql (part 1)

1. *Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases*: [source](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
|**SQL**|**NoSQL**|
|---|-----|
|*Relational Databases*|*Non-relational or distributed database*|
|*Table based databases*|*Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores*|
|*Predefined schema*|*Dynamic schema*|
|*Vertically scalable*|*Horizontally scalable*|
|*Uses structured query language*|*Uses unstructured Query Language*|

2. *What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database*? **Non-hierarchical data storage**.
3. *Give a real world example*. **MySQL Community Edition**.
4. *What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database*? **Hierarchical data storage**.
5. *Give a real world example*. **MongoDB**.
6. *Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage*? **NoSQL database**.
7. *Which type of database is best for scalability*? **NoSQL database**.

## nosql vs sql (part 2)

1. *What does SQL stand for*? **Structured Query Language**
2. *What is a realational database*? [source](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/)

A **relational database** is a *type* of *database* that **stores** and **provides access** to **data points** that are *related* to one another.

3. *What type of structure does a relational database work with*? **Table based structure**.
4. *What is a ‘schema’*? **A logical collection of database objects**.
5. *What is a NoSQL database*? **Its a non-relational database**.
6. *Howo does it work*?

The **database** *starts* with things called **collections**, they are like the **containers** of a *set types* of data *according* to a **shared title**, *inside* these **collections** there are things called **documents**, the **documents** are *sets of data* that **has no schema** *usually in JSON format*.

7. *What is inside of a Mongo database*? **collections and documents**

8. *Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB*? *and why*.

**MongoDB** is more *flexible*, because it's not *contoled* by **‘schemas’**.

9. *What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database*?

The *disadvantage* of **NoSQL database** is that it **dosen't have the reliability functions** *which* **Relational Databases have**.
