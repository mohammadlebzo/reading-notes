# Wireframes & HTML: definition and examples

### What is **Wireframes** ?
 Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

### What is ***HTML*** ?
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

### Some ***HTML*** Examples:
* #### **Adding Paragraphs**:
``` 
This is a paragraph 
``` 

```
<P> This is a paragraph </p>
```
The paragraph can be **Bold**, *Italic* or ***Bold and Italic***. 
```
<p>The paragraph can be **Bold**, *Italic* or ***Bold and Italic***.</p> 
```
