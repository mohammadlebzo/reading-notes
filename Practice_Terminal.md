# Terminal Practice

**CLI** or **Command Line Interface** is a text based interface that allows the user to have great control over the software by using commands and keywords.

### **Some Basic Navigation Commands**:

There are many but I'm going to mention only few of them:

|Command|What it does|
|-------|------------|
|pwb    |It is short for **Print Working Directory**, and thats exactly what it does, it tells you where you currently are|
|ls     |Which is short for **list**, and it lists all the files and folders in the current directory|
|ls -l  |Which is **Long Listing**, meaning it a list with all useful details about each file/folder.|
|cd     |Which is short for **Change Directory**, allows you to do just that by specifying the directory name. `cd dirctName`|

### **Some Importent Details About Linux**:

- Linux is **Extensionless**, meaning that Linux does not care about the extension, it just looks inside the file and determines what it is and gives back the result.
- Linux is **Case Sensitive**, meaning that "filename.txt" and "FileName.txt" are two different files.
- When naming files in Linux it is better to use **underscore** `"_"` rather than **spaces** as spaces are usally used to seperate items in Linux.

### **Using the Terminal Manual**:

The **Terminal Manual** is like a guide for the commands, explaning what they do.

In order to use this manual you just need to enter the command `man <needed command>` to get the explanation about that command, or enter the command `man -k <search term>` to get a command that holds that term or does it.

### **Some File Manipulation Commands**:

I will just name a few:

|Command|What it does|
|-------|------------|
|mkdir  |It allows you to make a **new directory** by entering `mkdir <directory name>`|
|rmdir  |It allows you to remove an **existing directory** by entering `rmdir <directory name>`|
|touch  |It allows you to create a **blank file** by entering `touch <file name>`|
