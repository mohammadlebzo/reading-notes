## Jupyter Lab

**What is it tho**? Jupyter Lab is a next-generation web-based user interface, that  allows you to work with documents and activities.

Jupyter Lab offers a lot of features, some of those are:

- It contains a coding IDE with all the features you would expect, like syntax error highlighting, builtin terminal/console.

- It supports a bunch of file formats, most of them are the most popular, like .jpg, .png, .gif, .pdf, .json, etc...

- It includes Jupyter Notebooks, which is a way to work with data and code seamlessly together

- It uncludes two modes when working with notebooks, **command** and **edit**:
    - Command mode is used for navigation and changing the framwork.
    - Edit mode is used for editing any cell in the notebook.

### Some useful keyboard shortcuts in Jupyter Notebook:

|**Shortcut**|**Use**|
|------------|-------|
|**a**|Add a cell above|
|**b**|Add a cell below|
|**c**|Copy a cell|
|**v**|Past a cell|
|**x**|Cut a cell|
|**(double) d**|Delete a cell|
|**z**|Undo|
|**Shift + z**|Redo|
|**y**|Chage to code format|
|**m**|Change to markdown format|
|**(double) 0**|Restart Kernel|

## Numpy

**What is it**? It's a commonly used data analysis package for python.

### Some importent methods/functions within **Numpy**:

|**Method**|**Use**|
|----------|-------|
|numpy.array|Creates a 2d numpy array, all elements in the array must be from the same type tho|
|numpy.zeros|Creates a 2d numpy array that is filled with zeros|
|numpy.random.rand|Creates a 2d numpy array, where each element has a random value|
|numpy.genformtxt|Reads from a file|
|dtype|Gets the data type of a numpy array|
|astype(type ex)|Converts the data type of a numpy array|

### Some **Numpy** array methods:

|**Method**|**Use**|
|----------|-------|
|sum|Returns the sum of all the elements in the array|
|shap|Returns the number of columns in an array|
