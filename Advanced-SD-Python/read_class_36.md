## Whiteboard Advice

Whiteboarding interviews are somewhat of a staple now in the industry, it is where the interviewee needs to solve a technical problem by explaining it on either a whiteboard, paper, or a computer.

So lets speek of some advices that interviewees need to keep in mind:

### Communicate:

This means that whatever your doing, and what ever your thinking about, always try to keep the interviewer updated, so they can understand your thought process, and analyze your problem solving skills.

### Ask About Edge Cases

Asking the interviewer about edge cases makes them realize that your are an analytical person, and that your are looking many steps forward to avoid bugs, and some times the interviewer isn't prepared for such a thing that they might make it easier to avoid some edge cases that they don't know, which protects you from them if they come later on.

### Ask About Test Cases

Asking the interviewer about test casses can help you save some time, by getting them without from the interviewer.

### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

Pseudocode is the easiest most general way to write code as you don't know if interviewer code in a different language than the one you use, or maybe they are not even programmers and they are just looking at the logic and if it makes sense.

### Stuck? Ask for Help!

Whenever your stuck, you should always ask for help as the interviewer will always offer it in some way, it might not be direct, it might come as a hint to help you.
