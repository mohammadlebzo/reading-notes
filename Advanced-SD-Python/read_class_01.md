## Big O Notation

**Big O Notation** is a way for us to be able to measure or describe the **complexity of an algorithm**, meaning we can measure the speed of execution and space that an algorithm will need.

### Now let's take a look at the main basic representations in this graph [source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-big-o-notation-to-crack-your-next-coding-interview-9d575e7eec4/)

As you can see the speed and effectiveness is represented in the graph with colors, from worst `O(n!)` to best `O(1)`.

So when you want to think of it code wise, you can think like this(***Its not always like this, these are just some examples***):

- **O(1)** ==> A function that only returns a value(without loops).
- **O(n)** ==> A function that includes one loop.
- **O(nÂ²)** ==> A function that includes nested loops.
- **O(2^n)** ==> A recursion function.
