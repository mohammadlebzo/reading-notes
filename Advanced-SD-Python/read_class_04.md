## Classes and Objects in Python

**Classes** and **Objects**, what are those??? Well **Classes** are templates that hold many attributes and features. Now **Objects** are created from **Classes**, which means that they use the attributes and features they offer.

### **The "self" parameter**:

Have you ever wondered why do we have this **"self"** parameter in some of the classes functions? Well thats because each time we make an object we create an instance of theta class, and the **"self"** prameter refers to that instance for each new created object, which give us great power to create scalable general templates.

### **Accessing Object Variables and Functions**:

In order to access variable within and object, you need to first create an instance of a class, which is the object, then you need to use the object name, then `.variable_name`, and just like that you can access it, but this way isn't just for variables its also for functions, the only difference is that you need to add the parameters for the function if it has some, or just put empty parentheses if it hasn't.

### **init() or \_\_init\_\_**

This function is the what we call the **constructor** in programming languages other than **Python**, it's used to help **pass some assintiol parameters** when **creating a new object**.


## Thinking Recursively in Python

What is **Recursion** function? Well a recursion function is a kind of where the function keep calling it self until a basecase is met, then it stops and gives the result.

**Note**: recursion uses a **stack** data structure, where each call adds to the **stack**.

Some examples on recursive data structures:
- List
- Set
- Tree
- Dectionary
