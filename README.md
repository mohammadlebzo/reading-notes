Lets start the summary with the definition of the term **Growth Mindset**,<br>
so a **Growth Mindset** believes that abilities and skills can be ferther improved by effort,
and that intelligence and talent are simply starting points that you need to build upon.<br>

In order for us to understand the benefits of the **Growth Mindset** <br>
we need to compare it to the **Fixed Mindset**:

| **Fixed Mindset**        | **Growth Mindset**        |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Avoids Challenges | Embraces Challenges |
| Loses focuse when facing obstacles | Persists on solving obstacles |
| Views efforts as meaningless | Believes in the meaning of effort |
| Ignores criticism | Learns from criticism |
| Views others success as therats | Gets inspired by others success |

What we can understand from all of the above is that, when embracing the **Growth Mindset** your 
more likely to go through challengesl and persisting on sloving all obstacles you face, you also
would be able to look at others success as an inspiration, and learn from others criticism to 
improve your <br> self.

If i would remind myself of three things to keep me in the **Growth Mindset**, <br> i would say:<br>
1. Keep asking for feedback whenever possible.
2. Remember that effort always pays off.
3. When ever you face obstacles take a step back and 2 forward.
