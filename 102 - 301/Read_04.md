# JavaScript: definition and Examples

* ### **What is JavaScript** ?
**JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles, mostly known as the scripting language for Web pages.


* ### **JavaScript Identifiers**:

All JavaScript **variable**s must be **identified** with **unique names**.<br>
These unique names are called **identifiers**.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).<br>
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
2. Names must begin with a letter.
3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

* ### Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables and ***Data Types***:
Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

You declare a JavaScript variable with the ```var``` keyword:
```
var firstName;
```
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of **numbers** and **strings**.

Declaring a **string**:
```
var firstName = John;
```

Declaring a **Number**:
```
var id = 2255;
```
