# Component-Based Architecture

## What is a component?

A **component** is a set of an ***encapsulated functionalities*** that are *reusable* and can be exported as a **higher-level interface**.

## What are the charactistics of a component?

**Components characteristics**:

- **Reusability**: *components* are designed to be used **multiple times** for specific situations.
- **Replaceable**: *components* can be freely **replaced** with similar *componenets* to achieve similar tasks.
- **Not context specific**: *components* are designed to be used **dynamically** for different situations.
- **Extensible**: *components* allow users to **add** to them to make them perform better or do more tasks.
- **Encapsulated**: *componets* **depict interfaces** to allow the caller to use their functionality **whithout exposing any of the internal processes details**.
- **Independent**: *components* have **minimal dependenceies** on other *components*.

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

**Advantages of using component based architecture**:

1. **Ease of deployment**: *replacing* versions with new ones **have no impact** on any of the other *components*.
2. **Reduced cost**: using *third-party components* allows for a **spread in the cost of development and maintenance**.
3. **Ease of development**: by *providing well-known interfaces* with their functionalities, which **allow for safe development without impacting other parts of the system**.
4. **Reusable**: *reusable components* **cuts** the development time and cost, also the cost fo the maintenance.
5. **Modification of technical complexity**: *complexity* can be **modified** through the us of the *component container and its services*.
6. **Reliability**: *components* are reliable as they are used and **created by reliable sources**.
7. **System maintenance and evolution**: can easily **change and update** *implementations* without affecting the rest of the system.
8. **Independent**: *components* are **independent** from the system and **can't directly affect the system** as they are **developed from a different trusted group**.

# What is “Props” and how to use it in React?

## What is props short for?

**Props** is a **React** *special keyword*, which stands for **properties**, and the main use for it is **passing data from one componenet to another**.

## How are props used in React?

**Props are used by**:

1. *Defining* an **attribute with a value**.

2. *Passing* the **value** to a child component(s) by using **props**.

3. *Rendering* the **props** data.

## What is the flow of props?

The flow of the props is a **uni-directional flow**. (**one way from parent to child**)

## Things I want to know more about
