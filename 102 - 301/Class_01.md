# The Creation of Websites(HTML, CSS and JavaScript):

In order for us to understand how to create websites, we need to unserstand first how does the web work and how to access it.

## How to access the web ?
People are able to access the web using softwares called **Web Browsers**, such as:
- [Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome)
- [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)
- [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)#Opera_GX)

Using such **web browsers** allows people to view web pages asking the browser, which will send a request to a specail computer known as a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) that hosts the websites.

## How does the web work ?
People are able to connect to the web via an **Internet Service Provider(ISP)**, and when connected people are able to type a domain aname or a web address into their browsers to visit sites. 

 And when visiting websites the web browser connects to a [Domain Name System(DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) server, so you can find the location of the hosting web server, as the hosting web server can be anywhere in the world.

 What happens is that they give the associated [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) with the requsted domain name.

 The unique number that the DNS server returns to the computer allows the browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.

Ok now, to now how to make websites we need to know what are HTML, CSS and JavaScript and also why and how do we use them.
