# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

**Google** started this quest in ***2011*** where they were focusing on how to bulid the *perfect team*, at first they thoguht that to build *perfect teams* they should just combine the best people together, but with time they found that this idea was wrong.

In order to make the *perfect team* they needed to make a study.
they had the idea of studying their employees in order to understand how *perfect teams* are built.

So in ***2012*** they embarked on an initiative — code-named [Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/) — to study hundreds of their employees in order to collect data and find any patterns that they can work with.

After that they started to test many things like building teams of people with *similar interests* or people *motivated by the same kinds of rewards*, but still, it was almost impossible to find any patterns. 

They struggled for a long time to figure out what made a team successful, but there was one reasearch they kept coming across, that research was focused on something called ‘‘*group norms*’’.

What is **Norms** you may ask ? Well, **norms** are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.

So when they learned about **norms** their researchers started looking through the data they collected, looking for **norms**

## Conclusion

After looking through handerds of groups data for more than a year, ***Project Aristotle*** researchers concluded that understanding and influencing *group norms* were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

The reasearch taught people within **Google** that no one wants to bottle him/her self when going to work and just do the work, as that would heart the performance of the that person because he/she will be leaving a part of themselves back home where they feel ***psychologically safe***. The workers must be able to feel ***psychologically safe***, to be able to share the things that scare them the most with eachother, they should be able to talk about the things that that are messy or sad, because that builds relations between them to be able to understand eachother and empathize with each other. And thats how the *perfect team* can be built.
