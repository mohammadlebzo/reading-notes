Lets start the summary with the definition of the term **Growth Mindset**,<br>

so a **Growth Mindset** believes that abilities and skills can be ferther improved by effort,
and that intelligence and talent are simply starting points that you need to build upon.<br>

In order for us to understand the benefits of the **Growth Mindset** 
we need to compare it to the **Fixed Mindset**:

| **Fixed Mindset**        | **Growth Mindset**        |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Avoids Challenges | Embraces Challenges |
| Loses focuse when facing obstacles | Persists on solving obstacles |
| Views efforts as meaningless | Believes in the meaning of effort |
| Ignores criticism | Learns from criticism |
| Views others success as therats | Gets inspired by others success |

What we can understand from all of the above is that, when embracing the <br>**Growth Mindset** your 
more likely to go through challengesl and persisting on sloving all obstacles you face, you also
would be able <br>to look at others success as an inspiration, and learn from others criticism to 
improve your self.

If i would remind myself of three things to keep me in the **Growth Mindset**, <br> i would say:<br>
1. Keep asking for feedback whenever possible.
2. Remember that effort always pays off.
3. When ever you face obstacles take a step back and 2 forward.
